# Second round tests

Here, tests are run within each machine-learning algorithm. MLP (Multi-layer Perceptron) tests were never run as they were just
a personal addition for which I lost interest. To run tests, I used each directory's sbatcher.sh, which ran slurm jobs of runner.sh
for each run_*.py script (or, in other words, each normalization method).
