# SCCR

- I've been using this branch for my python scripts
  - Been using this to run computationally pricey as well as long sklearn algorithms (more so with the length of time it takes to iterate through so many possible cases)
  - My personal laptop only has 4GB of RAM
  - The supercomputer has slurm jobs, allowing me to run a script and then let it run overnight
    - Even better, the supercomputer is accessible wherever

- Currently running different algorithms on ER positivity for two reasons:
  1. Test new possible algorithms to later use on the misclassified samples
  2. Test supposedly correlated genes like I did for her2 positivity
